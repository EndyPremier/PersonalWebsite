# PersonalWebsite-v1 (Archived)
This is an archived version of my website that was deployed in the UMass Boston server during my time in college. All the CSS and HTML was done by scratch. You can still peruse though it via GitHub Pages [here](https://endypremier.github.io/PersonalWebsite-v1/index.html).
